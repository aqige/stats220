# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220.

## A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Auckland.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to develop my skills in data science, programming, and modern data technologies.
- I am interested in learning about machine learning, AI, web data, and real-world data applications.
